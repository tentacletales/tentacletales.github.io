The Mauser C96 is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by German arms manufacturer Mauser.

The Mauser C96 has a very distinctive look - a box magazine in front of the trigger, a long barrel and a removable the wooden shoulder stock which gives it the stability of a short-barreled rifle and doubles as a holster or carrying case.

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Mauser C96 was the grip which was shaped like the handle of broom earning the gun the nickname of “Broomhandle”.

The long barrel and high-velocity cartridge of the Mauser C96 gave it superior range and better penetration than other period pistols.

The Mauser C96 earns it place place of honor from the Tentacled Gunslinger from its appearance in [Sergio Corbucci’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Corbucci) Spaghetti Western masterpiece [“Il grande silenzio” (The Great Silence, 1968)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Silence)wielded by the titular main character Silence portrayed by [Jean-Louis Trintignant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Trintignant).

The maximum distance of the C96 can only be achieved using the stock attached to the pistol.

The gun is purchased along with the removable stock but if a replacment is needed that can also be purchased.

As with the Buntline special, an enterprising Bedlamite could craft a modded stock with more goodies….
