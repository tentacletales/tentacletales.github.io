This past year, an early and unusally dry and hot drought season combined with Climate Change, resulted in a horrific series of fires in Australia which continues to burn to this day.

A mindnumbing 1 billion animals are now estimated dead due the fires in Australia fires and More than 15.6 million acres have been decimated. The number of kangaroos, koalas, and others killed keeps skyrocketing and estimates of economic impact to humans is also mindblowing - at least 24 people killed, over 1,400 homes destroyed. The costs of the fires in Sydney alone are estimated at **50 million a day**.

David Baity, the author of [Dark Trails](http://www.darktrails.com) and himself a firefighter has put together a relief raffle for the animals and people of Australia. 

I am posting his letter to the RPG community here in the hopes of boosting the signal.

Here is David:

"Hey Folks,
I’ve been working on something special for the last couple of weeks in response to the, truly horrific fires currently plaguing our friends in Australia. If you know me on any level, you probably know I’m a lover of all things feline and do a yearly prize raffle to raise money for local no-kill shelters in my area.

It’s hard to comprehend the death and destruction that the fires raging across Australia have caused and by now, we’ve all seen heartbreaking pictures floating around on the web. 

That brings me to the great news I’m sharing with you today. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks reaching out to friends I know in the industry in hopes they might donate some items for a charity raffle geared towards helping the animals and folks currently suffering in Australia.

The response has been amazing! Folks have jumped on board and offered some amazing prize support that I think will help make this raffle a big success! I’m going to list the prizes and donors below but want to lay out the important details first.

* There will be one winner for all physical and digital rewards. In the case of multiple digital prizes, we will draw additional names for the extras.
*	Each $1 donated will enter you once for the drawing. Throw $10 dollars at the cause and you’ll earn ten entries in the raffle.
*	The raffle will begin 2/01/2020 and end on midnight 02/29/2020 with the winner being determined randomly by someone well known in the community other than myself.
*	Shipping will be covered for physical prizes, some of which I already have on hand, while others will be mailed directly from our generous donors. In the case of a non-US winner, we will strive to work with you on shipping, but you may be partly responsible for some of the charges.
*	I’ve chosen Wires (Wildlife Information Rescue Education) and GIVIT after doing some research into current organizations raising funds and think you’ll find them worthy of what we raise.
*	 To donate click [here](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile)
