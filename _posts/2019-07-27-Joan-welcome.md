Howdy Pardners! And welcome to the Six-Gun Sorcery Podcast. Hitch 'em up, Saddle ’em up, and ride the trails with Marshall Mike and Marshall Joan as they regale the tales of the weird west stories, TV shows, movies, and games.

Grab your place around the campfire, grab a plate of stew, and your canteen while we settle in to rest a spell from the dusty trail.

We are glad you are here! We hope to cover some great weird west offerings from books, to radio and TV shows, to movies, to gaming that falls in the genre of the weird west. As I write this, I am struck with the possibility that I may be doing this well into my 80’s with all the information I have come across.

Look for Episode 0 to come out...relatively soon. Wow, what does that mean? Well pardner, we’d like to know that too. But really keep watching for it. The trail is long and dusty with nary a watering hole in sight. The horses keep getting slower and slower. And those oases we see have proven to give us no hope for refreshment. When we do arrive, we hope to have a long drink of cool water and after, possibly a shot of that firewater we’ve heard about. With that out, comes the weird tales of the long dusty ride.

Marshall Mike and Marshall Joan get the Six-Gun Sorcery started off with an introduction to who we are and why we are so excited to bring you this podcast. Then we will follow with an episode reviewing “The Six-Gun Tarot”, the first book in The Golgotha series by R.S. Belcher. Followed by “A Fistful Of Dollars” a 1964 Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first leading role.

We definitely have lots we want to cover and bring to you for your reading, viewing, and gaming pleasure.

And most of all, we hope your enjoyment as we settle around the campfire after a long dusty ride on the trail for a wet of the whistle and a slumber under the stars.
