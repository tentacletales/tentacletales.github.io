I had been thinking about a Gorilla race template for [Dark Trails RPG](https://www.darktrailsrpg.com) based on Tuesday Night Fiend Club's excellent [Star Crawl](https://http://www.tuesdaynightfiendclub.com/) race templates.
Fortunately Justin Ryan Isaac on the [Dark Trails Facebook Group]9https://www.facebook.com/groups/darktrailsrpg/) kicked me into action.

Without further ado here is my Great Apes Dark Trails Race Template.(I also have a mouseling templateI'll repost here). 

Apologies again to David Baity and Jonathan Snodgrass!

# Great Ape Dark Trails Race Template

## Special Abilities:

Fist 1d6  
Skill checks: +1d  (anything strength related),  +2d climb checks (from page 7 of Primal Tales)

## Ability modifiers:

 -3 Per, +1 Sta +2 Str, +1 Stamina saves

## Class Modifications:

15’ movement when walking upright due to unusual gait. 30’ movement when using all four limbs to move.

**Brachiation** – some great apes like Orangutans can move with ease through the trees (30’ movement). These types of apes suffer another 5’ movement penalty when trying to walk outside of the trees.

**Intimidation** - Great Apes can inspire fear in other creatures - +1d to checks involving intimidation and fear

**Anger**- Great apes are prone to anger. When entering battle, they should roll a will save DC 12 or become enraged suffering -1d rolls on any attacks involving increased mental awareness (like wielding a gun). 

This lasts for one round and then allow another check for the great ape to regain control of its instincts. 

**_NOTE:_** A check should be made each time a great ape is wounded – subsequent wounds after the first impose a +2 to the DC.

## Description:

Some say that the talking great apes were the result of an experiment gone wrong. Some say that the seven days of night and its evil influence are responsible.
 
Whatever the reason, the first great ape gunslingers began to appear in western traveling Medicine shows and circuses and in the bustling streets of the cities of the coasts a few years after the dead wouldn’t stay dead.

The apes were quick to mimic their close cousins and while not common enough to not cause a stir, are certainly not a rarity.

Great Apes can be any one of the classes in Dark Trails though they gravitate toward gunslingers, luchadors and bedlamites.

## Famous Great Apes of the Weird West:

* King Kong

* Mighty Joe

* Silver Back Slim

* Knuckles Winslow

* Red Mclintock

* The Gorilla Kid

* El Gorila Loco
